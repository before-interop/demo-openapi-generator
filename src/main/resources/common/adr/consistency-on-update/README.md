# ADR - Consistency on update operations

**Status**: Accepted

This ADR must determine if we allow or not update operations on old entity versions.

All APIs are used in a distributed environment with multiple operators.
In this case, there is a possibility of concurrent updates on the same entity.

### Simple update operation

As we can see in the following sequence diagram,
the update in operation without concurrency is simple.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Actor A as User
  participant B as API

  A->>B: GET /{resource}/{resourceId}
  B->>A: 200 OK
  A->>A: Update resource
  A->>B: PUT /{resource}/{resourceId}
  B->>A: 200 OK
```

### Update operation with concurrency

As we can see in the following sequence diagram,
the entity is updated by two users at the same time.

The updates done the user A are lost because the user B updated the entity after the user A.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Actor A as User A
  Actor B as User B
  participant S as API

  A->>S: GET /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>A: 200 OK

  B->>S: GET /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>B: 200 OK

  A->>A: Update resource
  B->>B: Update resource

  A->>S: PUT /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>A: 200 OK

  B->>S: PUT /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>B: 200 OK
```

## Proposed Solution with ETag

The GET operation must return the `ETag` header with the entity version.

The PUT operation must use the `If-Match` header with the entity version.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Actor A as User A
  Actor B as User B
  participant S as API

  A->>S: GET /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>A: 200 OK with ETag version 1

  B->>S: GET /{resource}/{resourceId}
  S->>B: 200 OK with ETag version 1

  A->>A: Update resource
  B->>B: Update resource

  A->>S: PUT /{resource}/{resourceId} with If-Match version 1
  S->>A: 200 OK with ETag version 2

  B->>S: PUT /{resource}/{resourceId} with If-Match version 1
  S->>B: 412 Precondition Failed
```

## Considered Options

1. Allow update operations on old entity versions

2. Do not allow update operations on old entity versions

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Allow update operations on old entity versions

* Good, because it is simpler.
* Bad, because it can cause data loss.

### Do not allow update operations on old entity versions

* Good, because it can avoid data loss.
* Bad, because it is more complex.
